we want to know what are the entities which interact directly with our product during use

- we don't add:
- because the the text doesn't specify anything about it, and the system design do not include such sensors needed
- Repairer not included because we don't want to specify a specific interface for him, he needs to be qualified
- IMPORTANT: system design and context diagram must be consistent:
  - we have inserted the charging station inside the robot, this means that the charging station cannot be an actor, only the plug can
  - if the charging station was an actor, then we would not have the actor "Power socket"
