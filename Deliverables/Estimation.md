# Estimation approach
<Consider the EZGas  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course>
# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |   21   |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |    150  | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) |  3150  |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |     315      |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 9450â‚¬ | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |    2 calendar weekss   (10 day of active work)        |

Insert here Gantt chart with above activities

Requirements: only 2 people work at the same time, since low parallel work is possible in this phase.
Design: only 2 people working at the same time,  since low parallel work is possible in this phase.
Coding and Testing: Estimation Is based on a team of 4 people working at the project 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, writing code and tests at the same time divided in 2 sub-teams of 2 persons each.
